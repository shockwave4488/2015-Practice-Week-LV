~~~ROBOT CODE~~~
Periodic Tasks is currently broken because a select terminal is unwired.DONE
Make AutoShift a button on the DashBoard (The dashboard variable is already being read, if you look at the bottom left of the VI)
Toggle doesn't work. DONE
Move toggle to somewhere that makes more sense - Support Code? or a new utility folder? (toggle doesn't directly involve drive code) DONE
Deadzone VI: add the shockwave glyph DONE
move roller to periodic tasks, so we can control it in autonomous and teleop seamlessly like the conveyor. Maybe in the conveyor loop? DONE

Measure distances for autonomous to get actual values
Reset encoders in begin DONE

The dashboard isn't actually a part of the github repository - check the file and folder locations and make changes DONE
