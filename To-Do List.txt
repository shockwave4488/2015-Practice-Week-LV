~~~ROBOT CODE~~~
Periodic Tasks is currently broken because a select terminal is unwired.
Make AutoShift a button on the DashBoard (The dashboard variable is already being read, if you look at the bottom left of the VI)
Toggle doesn't work
Move toggle to somewhere that makes more sense - Support Code? or a new utility folder? (toggle doesn't directly involve drive code)
Deadzone VI: add the shockwave glyph
move roller to periodic tasks, so we can control it in autonomous and teleop seamlessly like the conveyor. Maybe in the conveyor loop?
Change autonomous to use the global variable(s) to control the conveyor (and roller, if that gets done)
Measure distances for autonomous to get actual values
Reset encoders in begin

~~~DASHBOARD~~~
The dashboard isn't actually a part of the github repository - check the file and folder locations and make changes
Deal with conflicts from above
I'll look at the dashboard when I can and update this list
